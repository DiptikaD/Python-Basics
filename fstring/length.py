# Problem Statement

# For this exercise, you'll need to fix this length.py program:

# name = input("What's your name? ")
# print("Hi Penelope!")
# print("Your name has 8 characters in it.")

name = input("What\'s your name? ")
print(f"Hi {name}!\nYour name has {len(name)} characters in it.")

# all tests pass including an unexpected success which is the bonus point
