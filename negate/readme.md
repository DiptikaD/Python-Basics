### I'd like you to write a function that accepts a list of lists of numbers and returns a new list of lists with each of the numbers negated.

It should work something like this:
~~~
matrix = [[1, -2], [-3, 4]]
negate(matrix)
[[-1, 2], [3, -4]]
matrix = [[1, -2, 3], [-4, 5, -6], [7, -8, 9]]
negate(matrix)
[[-1, 2, -3], [4, -5, 6], [-7, 8, -9]]
~~~
There are no bonuses, but I'd like you to put some effort into figuring out the clearest and most idiomatic way to solve this problem.
