# Problem Statement
# For this exercise, I'd like you to make two variables: x and y.

# The x variable should contain your favorite number (or any number at all).

# The y variable should contain the square of x.

# Don't write a number directly when assigning y though! Instead, use an appropriate arithmetic operator to square x instead.

x = 9
y = x*x

#ran test_square and got all ok!
