### I'd like you to write a function that accepts a list of strings and returns a list of all strings that start with a vowel.

It should work like this:
~~~
names = ["Alice", "Bob", "Christy", "Jules"]
get_vowel_names(names)
['Alice']
names = ["Scott", "Arthur", "Jan", "Elizabeth"]
get_vowel_names(names)
['Arthur', 'Elizabeth']
~~~
There are several ways to solve this one. For an extra challenge try solving this one in three different ways. See if you can figure out the clearest and most idiomatic way to solve this exercise.
